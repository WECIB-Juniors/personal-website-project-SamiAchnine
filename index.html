            <p>Good morning (or afternoon) those who are reading! I'm Sami and I enjoy developing programs, having fun, and making the most of my life in the time I've got. I'm currently a student in Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies, and I joined this school because I wanted to start working on my future. Ever since 8th grade, I've been interested in programming and computer science, and going to this school allowed me to learn this information in a way that other schools simply don't provide.<br><br>Some of my professional aspirations include making my own game and publishing it on a console, working for Epic Games, and even directing my own game under a larger studio. In general, I feel like I have good ideas and a good work ethic to execute upon my ideas. If there is an idea that I have the capabilities of seeing through to the end, I will be the first person to get it all done.<br><br>Each and every day, I do what I can to ensure that the days of the people I interact with are better, whether it's my closest friends or people I seldom interact with. I take this philosophy into my professional life-- my ultimate goal with any project is to give the people the best product possible that improves the day of the person who consumes it. Life can blow sometimes, but I hope that whatever I bring to others' lives ends up giving them joy.</p>

            <h2>Projects I've worked on</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <strong><li>Vibe-coding project for CTI110: </strong>A recent one. Me and Alex Frieders worked on a little story-based adventure game where he wrote the story and I wrote the code. I think the story was really good, and the various features I got to add (such as the cool animated background) really put everything together. In all, we had 1 week to make this.</li>
                <strong><li>2024 PBL project:</strong> Me and a group of about 3 other people from around the school presented a project about how social isolation in women related to the COVID lockdown. It ended up being really interesting to research, and I enjoyed working on it.</li>
                <strong><li>Spanish 2 final project:</strong> For my Spanish 2 final project, I wrote an entire book titled Bonzo: La diosa del agua. While I'm still debating whether I should publish the book, it got high praise from my teacher, my parents (who both speak Spanish) and my extended family. If I do properly release it, I'll update this site with a link to purchase it.</li>
