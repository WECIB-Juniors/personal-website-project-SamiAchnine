        <h2>Some of my hobbies and interests:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sonic the Hedgehog games:</strong> This is one of my <em>favorite</em> game series of all time. I have played over 1000 hours of Sonic games combined, and I enjoy talking about these games to other people. My top three favorite Sonic games are Sonic Frontiers, Shadow Generations, and Sonic Unleashed. I started really liking the Sonic series in 2021, and since then I've played almost every game (I'll get to you eventually, Sonic and the Black Knight).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Editing videos:</strong> I've turned this more into a job now, but I still find hobby-like enjoyment in this one. Editing is the part of video production that most dread, but for me, it's the life-blood of a video that can take an okay concept into an amazing audio-visual experience. Personally, I find the most enjoyment in editing video essays, since those leave the most leeway for funny edits.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Level design for level editors (Mario Maker, Fall Guys, etc): </strong> This is another thing that I really enjoy doing in my spare time, though it is less common for me to do since I really need to sit down and commit to it. When I was 10 years old, I got Super Mario Maker 2 for my birthday, this being a video game where you can create your own Mario levels and share them with the world, and since then, any platformer game with a Level editor becomes a game where I spend the next year or more of my life in. Fall Guys released its level editor in May 2024 (Fall Guys Creative), and I've also created various levels, always pushing the limits of what's possible in those fairly limited level editors.</li>
